# My Workout Planning App

So recently my brother and I started going to the gym. I've been going through some tough times mentally and it's caused me to put on a little weight and hurt my confidence. We figured going to the gym might help those some. So I wanted to make an app that helps us plan out our workouts so that we can make the most of the time we spend there as well as help track precious milestones and current goals.
